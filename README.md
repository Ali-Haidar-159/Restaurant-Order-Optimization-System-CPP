# Restaurant Order Optimization System

This project is a Restaurant Order Optimization System developed in C++. The system enhances restaurant operations by integrating several optimization algorithms
to manage and streamline food orders and reservations. It features functionalities such as viewing menu cards, placing orders, designing menus, and reserving tables. 
The use of algorithms like Binary Search, Merge Sort, Coin Change, and Fractional Knapsack aims to optimize various aspects of restaurant management.

## Features

- **View Menu Cards**: Display available menu items and their details.
- **Order Food**: Place orders for food items from the menu.
- **Menu Design**: Create and manage menu items and their pricing.
- **Table Reservation**: Reserve tables for customers.

## Algorithms Used

- **Binary Search**: Efficiently search for items in a sorted menu.
- **Merge Sort**: Sort menu items or order details for better organization.
- **Coin Change**: Optimize change given to customers in transactions.
- **Fractional Knapsack**: Optimize the allocation of resources or ingredients.
